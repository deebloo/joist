### [Read introduction here](https://dev.to/deebloo/introducing-joist-4724)

A small (~2kb or ~5kb with lit-html) library to help with the creation of web components and web component based applications. Support for [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) is baked in but can work with whatever view library you like. [See it in action](https://webcomponents.dev/edit/ZwmxGJSHldWQH5T7j8fH).

## Getting Started

### [webcomponents.dev](https://webcomponents.dev/new/)
The easiest way get started with Joist is to go to use the Joist starter on [webcomponents.dev](https://webcomponents.dev/create/joist).
There you can play around with Joist (and other frameworks) with 0 setup required. (You can even test and publish!)

### [starter-app-snowpack](https://github.com/joist-framework/starter-app-snowpack)
If you want to build an application or just run everything yourself you can use the [snowpack starter app](https://github.com/joist-framework/starter-app-snowpack). This starter uses snowpack for dev and rollup for creating your production bundle.

```BASH
npx create-snowpack-app my-app --template @joist/starter-snowpack
```
